# ITRI616_ML_PROJECT
# Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
- `notebook_color.ipynb`: for training a DCNN on RGB vs Grayscale images of the **same identities**, to evaluate the impact of **color**.
- `notebook_identity.ipynb`: for training a DCNN on RGB vs Grayscale images of **different identities**, to evaluate the combined effect of **identity and color** variation.
